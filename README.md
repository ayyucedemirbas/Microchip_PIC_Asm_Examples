# Microchip_PIC_Asm_Examples
I'm sharing PIC microprocessor programs in assembly
First of all, download MPLAB IDE (not MPLABX IDE) using this link https://pic-microcontroller.com/mplab-ide-v8-92-free-download/

and install it. When it's done open the program and go to Debugger==> Select Tool and click MPLAB SIM (i don't know why, just do it)
Now you are ready to write your super cool programs. Open your favourite text editor and write code (or copy paste). And save this file as assembly file (.asm file). Then return back to MPLAB, open your file and click Project ==> Quickbuild yourFile.asm. At this point you can add some brakpoints to your code by double clicking the lines and you can see the current value of working register, program counter etc.
