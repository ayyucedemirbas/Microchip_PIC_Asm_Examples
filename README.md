I'm sharing PIC microprocessor programs in assembly and the lecture notes.

Most of these contents don't belong to me. Thank you so much all of the contributors. You all are secret heroes. We love you.

Students (and makers of course), you can ask me your questions about PIC assembly. To do that please create an issue or ping me on @demirbasayyuce twitter account. 

Contributions are welcome! Please open pull requests. Thank you so much :)

First of all, download MPLAB IDE (not MPLABX IDE) using this link https://pic-microcontroller.com/mplab-ide-v8-92-free-download/

and install it. When it's done open the program and go to Debugger==> Select Tool and click MPLAB SIM (i don't know why, just do it)
Now you are ready to write your super cool programs. Open your favorite text editor and write code (or copy paste). And save this file as assembly file (.asm file). Then return back to MPLAB, open your file and click Project ==> Quickbuild yourFile.asm. At this point you can add some breakpoints to your code by double clicking the lines and you can see the current value of working register, program counter etc.

And yes you should use Windows for MPLAB. (My machine is dualboot I also use Ubuntu)
