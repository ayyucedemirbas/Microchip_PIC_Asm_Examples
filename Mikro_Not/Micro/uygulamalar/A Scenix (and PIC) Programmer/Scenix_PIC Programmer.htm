<font size="+2"><b><u></u></b><center><b><u>"Fluffy" - A Scenix (and PIC) Programmer</u></b></center></font>
<br><br>
<br><br>
I was trying to think of a suitable name for this project, and after literally
seconds of careful deliberation, I gave up and decided to call it <b><i>Fluffy</i></b>.
Sorry.
<br><br>
Anyway, Fluffy is a SX programmer for people who have already experimented
with PIC chips, and want to try out the Scenix SX family.
I built Fluffy because I wanted to experiment with the SX's, but didn't
want to spend $300 or so bucks on the official development system.
To build it, you will need a PIC16F84 (a 16C84 will probably also work,
but I don't have any to test!). Note that this implies you should already
have a working PIC programmer. If you don't, you might want to check out
<b>COM84</b>, or any of the multitude of free, cheap PIC programmers available
on the web.
<br><br>
As usual, the standard disclaimers apply. I accept absolutely no
responsibility for any damage caused by the use of this system. It seems to
work just fine for me, but if it happens to blow up your chips, melt your
computer or exterminate your family and friends, etc... etc... then don't come
crying to me. Fluffy is completely free - please go ahead and use/distribute
as you wish, provided that it's used only for noncommercial purposes, and the
above disclaimer is also distributed with it.
<br><br>
<b>21st May 2001</b><br>
<br>
Steven Willis has been working on a new version of Fluffy, with improved
serial port speed, and a number of bug fixes. Since I'm no longer actively
maintaining this project, you may want to head over to
<a href="http://www.semis.demon.co.uk/">his page</a> and get the latest
code from there. Thanks also to Bonny Gijzen for adding Fluffy support
to his excellent <a href="http://www.ic-prog.com/">IC-Prog</a> PC software.
<br>
<br><br>
<b><u>Version Information</u></b><br>
<i>fluffy</i> is currently undergoing a few changes, mainly brought about
by Scenix's recent silicon revision. Therefore, there are currently a few
different version available...
<br><br>
<b><a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/%7Eben/sens/pic/sx/0928fluf.zip">0928fluf.zip</a></b> - Sept 28th 1999
<br>
This is the latest code, which uses a completely rewritten <b>fluffy.exe</b>.
The firmware code has also been upgraded to support the 16C6X class of PICs.
The main things to be aware of with this
version are that the <b>-test</b> option has been removed, as has the support
for the <b>fluffy.ini</b> config file. Everything is now on the command line,
and some of the command-line options have changed. The code has been changed
in such a way as to make adding more chips easier. At present, support for
SX (old and new revs), 16F84, 16C84, and 16C64 is included. In theory a much
larger range of PICs <i>should</i> be supported, simply by adding the relevant
lines in the <b>chips[]</b> array, but I just haven't had time.
<br><b>STOP PRESS</b>I just received some samples of the new revision SX18/28's
from Scenix. The really quick test that I just did suggests that the code is
working. I've just added <b>simplel.sxh</b> to the ZIP file, which is the
equivalent of <b>simple.sxh</b>, but for the new revision.
<br><br>
<font size="+2">DOH!</font> It seems some of you are experiencing problems
with the new code, when using the parallel port interface. I've just tried
to track down the problem, but my programmer doesn't seem to work with my
new PC! (I haven't touched SX chips for quite a while). If you do
experience this problem, can you please first try the older version of the
code, and then let me know what works, and what doesn't. Thanks!
<br><br>
<b><a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/%7Eben/sens/pic/sx/0216fluf.zip">0216fluf.zip</a></b> - Feb 16th 1999
<br>
This is the <i>original</i>, much older code. It has a very different interface,
and only supports the older SX revision. It does, however, have a semi-useful
<b>-test</b> command-line option, which runs through some simple diagnostics,
enabling you to hopefully verify that your programmer is built correctly.
<br><br>
I apologise for the somewhat disorganised nature of these releases, but
I am <i>unfeasibly</i> busy at the moment, and thus unable to spend the
time I'd like to on this...

Anyway, here's the schematic - I hope I've drawn everything right. Basically
A0 and A1 control the SX OSC1 voltage level - both low implies 0V, A0 high
(and A1 low) implies 5V, and A1 high (and A0 low) gives 12.5Vish. If
you want to implement your own power supply circuit, it shouldn't be too hard.

<u><b>2nd Sep 2000</b></u><br>
Just a quick update - "Ling SM" has sent me a few pictures of a nice
portable implementation of Fluffy. As you can see, there are some spare
components available - email
<a href="mailto:decoder@bigfoot.com">decoder@bigfoot.com</a> for details.

<u><b>2nd Mar 1999</b></u><br>
A number of people have written to me, offering to write a W95/NT version
of the PC software. Since it's unlikely that I'll have time to do this
myself, anyone who wants to is more than welcome! I realise that <b>fluffy.c</b>
and <b>sxprog.asm</b>, although commented in places, aren't necessarily the
most legible or intuitive pieces of code in the world. So, in the spirit of
open protocols, (and in a thinly disguised attempt to get other people to
do this stuff for me), my attempt at documenting Fluffy's protocol is
<a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/%7Eben/sens/pic/sx/protocol.zip">here</a>, in MS Word format.
<br><br>
<u><b>1st Mar 1999</b></u><br>
Just a quick note - there has been some discussion of late regarding
SX chips' propensity for suddenly deciding to draw a large amount of
current, in some cases resulting in a hot, unpleasant smelling chip death.
This appears to be a problem with SX chips in general - people using
programmers other than Fluffy have experienced it, as have I. One suggested
safeguard is to put a 100 ohm resistor between the programmer's OSC1 output, and the
SX's OSC1 pin. I haven't cooked a chip for a while, but hey, best to be safe.
<br><br>
<u><b>23rd Feb 1999</b></u><br>
Apparently not all diodes are created equal, and a 1N914 or 1N4148 is more
suitable for the voltage adjustment on the 7812 (Thanks Al). Schematic updated
accordingly.
<br><br>
<u><b>16th Feb 1999</b></u><br>
Got rid of <b>sxtest1.exe</b> and <b>sxtest2.exe</b>. They have been replaced
by a <b>-test</b> command line option in <b>fluffy.exe</b>. This enables both
serial and parallel port programmers to be tested using the same software that
you actually use for programming. Much more sensible.
<br><br>
<u><b>15th Feb 1999</b></u><br>
Okay... the schematic now contains the serial interface modifications, and
the zip file has been updated. Simply specify <b>-com1</b>, <b>-com2</b>, etc...
to specify a serial port to be used. If you don't specify a serial port, the
parallel port will be used by default. Note that if you want to build a
programmer that can attach to either port, you'll need to use jumper <b>J1</b>.
This is simply to stop the MAX232 driving the A2 line when using the parallel
interface. The serial communications run at 38400 baud, and all handshaking
is done in software. Also, <b>sxtest1.zip</b> and <b>sxtest2.zip</b> are
for the parallel port interface only... haven't got around to updating them.
A word of warning - the serial stuff is fairly untested... it seems to work
for me, (although I did fry a few SX chips, seemingly due to a dodgy programming
voltage level on my new board - SX's seem to be much less robust than PICs) -
so use it at your own risk!!!
<br><br>
<u><b>14th Feb 1999</b></u><br>
I haven't updated this page for a couple of weeks, because I've been
a bit busy with <a href="http://www.left.com/">my real job</a>.
The serial interface seems to be working fine, but I haven't put it into the
full circuit yet. As I type, a new PCB is etching away slowly, and if this
board works, I'll post the schematic/software mods over the next day or two.
The only extra components are a MAX232 (plus 4 caps), a jumper and a
pullup resistor on MCLR. The jumper is only required if you want to be
able to use the programmer with both parallel <i>and</i> serial interfaces.
The same software is used on both the 16F84 and the PC, regardless of interface.
<br><br>
<u><b>1st Feb 1999</b></u><br>
Oops! Apologies... fixed a small bug in the PC software, that didn't raise the
MCLR line to 5V after programming PICs. <b>allnew.zip</b> has been updated
accordingly. I've also re-ordered things a little bit. Also, for the sake of
completeness, here's a picture of my implementation of Fluffy...<br><br>

Yes, I know it's just a black box, but I'm not going to show the insides,
otherwise people will make fun of my complete lack of electrical expertise!
(As I've repeatedly stated, I'm a programmer, not an engineer!!!). I've
probably ignored all the important rules about ground planes, heatsinks,
blobs of solder everywhere, blah blah blah... All I know is it seems to
work, so I'm happy.
<br><br>
<u><b>30th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
Got the programmer to successfully program a 16F84. There is an updated
<b>fluffy.exe</b> in the all new <a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/%7Eben/sens/pic/sx/allnew.zip">allnew.zip</a>. This
is a direct replacement for the older version of <b>all.zip</b> - it
contains updated PC and PIC code. Note that the schematic now also shows
the alternate connections to the target PIC. Don't forget to check
<b>fluffy.txt</b> for the new PIC-related syntax. Now, since I don't have
any PICs other than 16F84's, I have no idea if it'll work on other PICs.
Your mileage may well vary. I'm currently also considering adding RS232
support to the programmer. This will probably entail a few extra components,
but should allow the programmer to be truly platform independant. Which is
nice.
<br><br>
<u><b>28th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
I've been a bit busy doing real-work-related things over the past week, and
consequently haven't had as much time as I'd have liked to work on Fluffy.
However, I've started modifying the 16F84 code, to allow PIC programming as
well. It's looking good so far, and the only modification to the circuit is
the addition of a 4.7K pullup on A4. (The astute observers among you will
have noticed its sudden appearance on the schematic). Once I've made the
necessary mods to the PC software, I'll post the lot.
<br><br>
<u><b>23rd Jan 1999</b></u><br>
The assembler, <b>flufasm</b> is <a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/%7Eben/sens/pic/sx/flufasm.zip">here</a>. It's probably
still full of bugs, and it doesn't do macros, but hey. It uses a Microchip-style
syntax, not Scenix. I'm including <b>demo.asm</b>, which is a <i>really</i>
annoying demo program. Attach a piezo speaker to B0, and you'll see what I
mean. Anyway, <b>demo.asm</b> should give you an idea of the syntax. Please
don't write to me telling me about ways to improve the assembler - I'm going
to do a full rewrite at some stage anyway. It's built as an NT executable, so
you'll have to run it from the command line under NT or 95. Also, make sure
<b>inst.dat</b> is either in the current directory, or the same directory as the
executable.
<br><br>
<u><b>20th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
Doh! My laptop broke, so I've sent it back to be repaired. Sadly, I forgot
to grab the assembler code off it. I have a backup, but it's at work, and
I'm at home with the flu! No asm today, folks.<br>
Thanks to Luis Correia
(<a href="mailto:lfcorreia@hotmail.com">lfcorreia@hotmail.com</a>),
there are some pictures of his implementation of Fluffy.
Luis has offered to produce a Protel circuit/PCB, so keep checking this page!

<u><b>19th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
Fixed minor stupid bug in the programmer software, that required a fuse
configuration to be specified, even when reading the chip. Duh.
The assembler, <b>flufasm</b> is kind of working, and hopefully I should
be able to post something soon.
<br><br>
<u><b>18th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
<b>fluffy.c</b> had a minor update to allow it to accept fuse configurations
from a <b>fluffy.ini</b> file and the command line. This means that any
assembler capable of producing Intel Hex format files can be used with the
system. I've also added <b>fluffy.txt</b> which explains things in a little
more detail. In a surprising fit of activity, I've also started writing an
assembler for the SX chips. Whether it'll ever get finished or not is anybody's
guess. Watch this space...
<br><br>
<u><b>17th Jan 1999</b></u><br>
I've been messing with the PC code, and I think it's stable enough to be
released. I haven't tested it <i>that</i> extensively, but it's looking good
so far. The only input format it supports at present is <a href="http://www.parallaxinc.com/">
Parallax Inc's</a> <b>.SXH</b> format, which is actually just Intel Hex format
with the FUSE and FUSEX words mapped at 0x1010 and 0x1011.
