<font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="5"><b>Bird Transmitter</b></font><br>

<font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">
This transmitter is custom made for bird listening.<br>
It is a PLL controlled FM transmitter which deliver 100mW at 88-108MHz.<br>
The transmitter is based on my FM transmitter and have micro-controller and <br>
microphone implemented on the circuit board.<br>
Since it use PLL, the frequency is very stable and can be set by 2 jumpers.<br>
The antenna is only 30cm and transmitting distance is up to 500m.<br>
The power supply is 9V and the current is about 90-100mA.<br>

A mail from Spain started this project. It was Carlos who asked me if I could custom build a 
transmitter. <br>
The idea was interesting and most of the work has already been done in my previous RF projects, 
so I had a go for it. <br>
The main part of this transmitter is based on my  FM PLL controlled VCO unit (Part II). <br>
What I needed to implement is a PIC16F870 processor and a microphone amplifier. <br>
<br>
One criteria of the construction was a short antenna which makes it more difficult. 
I can not emphasise how important a proper antenna is in a transmitter. 
If you are unlucky you might just get a few % of energy out into the air and the rest will reflect back and mess it all <br>up. Anyhow, the antenna of this construction is 30-35cm wire and it works..I will not say more..*smiling* <br>

So, lets look at the schematic. <br>
Most parts will be recognised from the FM project, but two parts are different. <br>
The microphone can be found to the top left corner. <br>
A NPN transistor amplifies the signal and a potentiometer set the input signal to the FM 
modulator part. <br>
If you look at the PIC you will see it controls the PLL and two jumpers SW1 and SW2 will 
select the frequencies. <br><br>
The table show you the actual frequencies for this project. <br>
All you need to do is to change the jumper and the PIC will update the PLL with new frequency. <br>

<font color="#0080ff" face="Arial" size="3"><b>Field test</b><br></font>

My test was performed in an open area and I used my car to measure the transmitting distance. <br>
I places the transmitter about 1 m above ground close to some trees with birds. I then went to 
my car and turned on the radio. <br>
This transmitter works perfect and the audio quality was beyond my expectations. <br>
So I drove a way 100m, still with perfect audio..then 200, 300, 400 and at 500m I was not 
"line in sight" and at that point I started to get some noise and sparks. What a performance! <br>
<br>
At 200-300m away I could sit in my car and listen to perfect audio from birds singing. <br>
It sounded like I had them in the backs seat of my car. <br>

<font color="#0080ff" face="Arial" size="3"><b>Final word</b></font>

<br>
This project describes the FM PLL controlled VCO unit working with a micro-controller and a microphone.<br>
Again, this is a strictly educational project explaining how a RF amplifier can be built and used.<br>
According to the law it is legal to build them, but not to use them.<br>
<br>
You can always mail me if there is anything unclear.<br>
I wish you good luck with your projects and thanks for visit my page.
