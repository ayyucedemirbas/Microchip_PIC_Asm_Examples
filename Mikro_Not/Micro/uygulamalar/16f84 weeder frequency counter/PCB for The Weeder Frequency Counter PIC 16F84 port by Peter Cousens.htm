<H1>PCB for <A href="http://www.piclist.com/techref/piclist/weedfreq.htm">The 
Weeder Frequency Counter PIC 16F84 port by Peter Cousens</A> </H1>
<H3>By Michael Sandvad [mss001 at hotmail,com] </H3>
<P>
<P>Included in the <A 
href="http://www.piclist.com/images/boards/weedfreq/FreqcounterPCB.zip">.zip 
archive</A> is the protel <A 
href="http://www.piclist.com/images/boards/weedfreq/freq%20counter-Protel.PCB">pcb 
file</A> and <A 
href="http://www.piclist.com/images/boards/weedfreq/FreqcounterPCB.pdf">.pdf 
file</A> of the pcb i made. It also contains the <A 
href="http://www.piclist.com/images/boards/weedfreq/Schem.gif">schematic</A> 
<I>{for this version; less the preamp, etc... }</I> and the <A 
href="http://www.piclist.com/images/boards/weedfreq/Layout.gif">component 
layout</A>. The pcb is intended to be used with a led backlighted display and 
has a current limiting resistor for this (can be used with a non backlit display 
too). The pcb will fit on the back of a <A 
href="http://www.powertip.com.tw/">Powertip</A> <A 
href="http://www.powertip.com.tw/product/pro_char.asp">16x1 character LCD</A>, 
making the finished counter quite compact. I'm not sure if the holes fit other 
manufactures lcd modules. 
<P>Please note that the variable resistor (display contrast) and the variable 
capacitor (crystal osc frequency) should be mounted on the bottom of the pcb, 
the trace side, to allow adjustments to be made to the assembled frequency 
counter, these components are drawn in green on the layout plan. 
<P>Also I did not include the preamp as I am driving the counter with a ttl 
signal. I have made 2 frequency counters using this pcb and both work exellent.
