     APRS Tracker is a firmware for APRS beacons based on a PIC processor such
     as the well known Tinytrak.
     (Version 0.7 supported both the PIC16F84 as the PIC16F6xx, version 0.8 only
     works with the PIC16F628 or PIC16F648).
     It is distributed under the GNU GPL.

    This software is also used for the 
    <a href="http://www.jancorver.org/bouw/track/">KF161-Tracker</a>,
    a tracker that can be build into a Bosch KF161 instead of the tone unit.

     There are several reasons why I wrote this firmware instead of using one
     of the hex files available on the web.<br>
     I have a GPS receiver that outputs GPGGA messages and wanted a Tinytrak that
     could use them. I also wanted to build it myself and experiment with it.
     Experimentation is the most important aspect of my hobby and as
     such I want to be able to not only use my tracker but also to change it as
     I like.
     This is also the reason I published it under the GPL, I want others to be
     able to continue to experiment and learn from my experience and I can again
     learn from theirs.
     While searching for tinytrak sourcecode I did found a project called SOTT
     (Son of TinyTrak) by Michael Pendley K5ATM. 
     Unfortunatly it also didn't understand GPGGA sentences and it was written
     for a very specific compiler I did not have access to.
     I decided not to port the code but to start over myself and use Michaels
     comments as a guide.

      The current version is version 0.8:
      </p><ul>
       <li>understands GPGGA and GPVTG sentences
       </li><li>does smartbeaconing (0.8 has improved smartbeaconing)
       </li><li>autodetects serial polarity (RS232 or TTL)
       </li><li>has 4800 and 9600 Baud support
       </li><li>is configurable via a serial null-modem cable<br>
          <i>Included is a config program for linux, please don't ask for a windows
           tool, I won't make it (if anyone really wants it it is not that hard to
           do yourself)</i>
  	 <b><i>Ok, so not everyboddy uses Linux yet... below you can download a
  	 floppy image I made with a menu controlled version of the config tool
	 </i></b>
       </li><li>reports course and speed
       </li><li>includes altitude reporting
       </li><li>Works with PIC16F84, PIC16F627, PIC16F628 and PIC16F648 controllers.
      </li></ul>
      The digipeater path has a default of RELAY WIDE2-2, this should be enough
      for normal use. Please think carefully before changing it!!!!!!
      (In fact changing it isn't even implemented in the current config tool :)

    <a href="http://sharon.esrac.ele.tue.nl/users/pe1rxq/aprstracker/atprogram.dsk">atprogram.dsk</a> is a floppy image containing a
    linux kernel and the config tool. Write this file to a floppy disk with
    a tool such as <a href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/%7Ejn/linux/rawwrite.htm">
    rawwrite</a> and boot your computer with it. (It needs atleast a 386)
    <br>
    For the curious: The disk image contains a linux 2.4.20 kernel with just
    about everything stripped out and a modified atprogram (with some basic menu)
    compiled against <a href="http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/">dietlibc</a>.
    </p><p>
    The programming protocol is relativly simple, connect a serial cross cable
    to the tracker on the gps port.
    To put the tracker in programming mode send the '!' character.
    The tracker will report itself with 'AT' followed by two version bytes.
    The first version byte is the firmware version, the second the ROM map version
    (All firmware versions with the same ROM map version number look the same
    to the programmer.)
    When in programming mode you can read and write the 64 bytes of internal
    eeprom memmory with the read command ('R' followed by the address, the
    tracker responds with one byte) and the write command ('W' followed
    by the address and the to be written byte, tracker responds with the data
    written).
    Any other character than 'R' and 'W' will return the tracker in normal
    operating mode.
