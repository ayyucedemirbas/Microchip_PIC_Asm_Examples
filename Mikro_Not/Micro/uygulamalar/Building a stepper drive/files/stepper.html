<p>Unipolar stepper motors can easily be retrieved from old 5.25"
floppy drives (together with a lot of other useful components: see the
"Floppy Tester" page). Because the speed has to be slowed down to
siderial or even lower, the effective torque will increase
proportionally. Therefore it is perfectly possible to drive relatively
large scopes with such small motors.<br><br>
<img src="stepper_files/flopstep.jpg"><br><br>
When properly driven, stepping rates of a few steps per second are
possible, although these rates are in the danger zone with respect to
resonance effects. The floppy motors do 200 full steps per second, and
the revolution rate can then be as low as 10 rpm. For tracking in an
equatorial mount this has to be converted to 1 revolution per siderial
day (approximately 23h 56m), which is a ratio in the order of 14360:1.
This ratio has to be realized mechanically, for exmple with a gear
train.<br>
When the steppers are driven binary, i.e. with square waves, the best
you can do is half steps, or 400 per revolution. The resolution of a
half step must be lower than de resolving power of the scope, say 0.25
arcsecond. This means that resolutionwise, each half step (0.9°) must
be reduced to 0.25". This would require a reduction ratio of 12960:1,
again to be realized mechanically.<br>
As an example, my RFT scope has an equatorial fork mount riding on a
polar disk of 230mm diameter, which is driven by an axle of 5mm
diameter. This axle is the output of a geartrain of 12:20 and a 1:40
worm. In total the reduction is just over 3000, requiring a stepper
revolution rate of approximately 2rpm.

<a name="circuits"><h2>Driving the stepper motor</h2></a>
<p>In general a stepper drive citcuit splits up in two parts: the
control logic and the current driver. The drive logic generates the
signal patterns that will activate the windings of the stepper motor,
and hence control the stepping rate and direction. The current driver
converts these signals into a current through the motor windings, where
the torque is proportional to the current.<br>
See <a href="http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/%7Ejones/step/">"Jones on Stepping motors"</a> for an extensive treaty on controlling steppers.<br><br>
<img src="stepper_files/blocksch.gif"><br><br>
Below three modes are described: discrete steps (half or full), analog control, microstepping.</p>
<h3>Full or half stepping</h3>
<p>The nice thing about the unipolar stepper is that the drive circuit
can be relatively simple. Given a stepping rate well away from the
resonance frequency, some discrete logic combined with a <a href="http://www.st.com/stonline/books/ascii/docs/1538.htm">2803</a><a>
octal darlington driving chip will do. Disadvantages are a jerky step
behaviour, resulting in all kinds of vibrations, and relatively high
minimum stepping rate (50 halfsteps per sec or so). Many examples of
such simple driver circuits can be found on the web.</a></p>
<h3><a>Sine/cosine drive</a></h3>
<p><a>A better approach, allowing much lower stepping rates, is to use
sine/cosine waves (or at least an approximation) to drive the motor
windings. The signal is similar to the halfstep driver, but instead of
blocks the positive halves of the sine wave are used to control the
current in each winding. This could in principle be realized with an
analogue quadrature oscillator, which delivers a sine and a cosine
signal of the same frequency. The downside of this method is that a
quadrature oscillator is almost impossible to make, without the phase
difference, amplitude and shape of the signal to be frequency
dependent. This means that a certain design can only be used in a very
limited range of stepping rates.</a></p>
<h3><a>Microstepping</a></h3>
<p><a>The usual way to overcome this problem is to use Pulse Width
Modulation (PWM) or an A/D converter to determine the current value.
Such circuits are usually microprocessor controlled and can have a wide
bandwidth of stepping rates. The microcontroller divides a full step
into a number of microsteps, and outputs the corresponding sine values
ether by changing the PWM dutycycle, or as a binary input for an ADC.</a></p>

<h3>PIC 16F628 and ULN2803</h3>
<img src="stepper_files/d_circuit.gif"><br><br>
<b>Note</b> that this circuit has not been built or tested<p></p>
<p>The circuit consists of only three ICs, a ULN2803 that drives the
steppers, a MAX232 for interfacing to the PC, and a PIC 16F628
microcontroller. This PIC type has built in USART circuits, that make
implementation of an RS232 interface a breeze. All that is needed is to
connect a RS232 line driver to the USART I/O pins of the PIC, being
port B bits 1 and 2. For driving the darlington array both I/O ports
are used: port A(0..3) and port B(4..7). Vdd (12V) leads directly to
the stepper driver, the stepper itself and also to an LM78L05 voltage
regulator, which makes the Vcc. Last two items are the crystal
oscillator, and the reset circuit R1/C7.</p>
<p>The PC interface is intended to work on 9600 baud, which should be
plenty fast for the few controls that pass through it. These controls
should facilitate setting the current coordinates and time, retrieving
the current coordinates (and time?), slewing and possibly also some
calibration of the tracking speed.<br>
Part of the intelligence, such as conversions of coordinates to steps
and v.v., taking acceleration into account when moving between
coordinates and such, is contained in the PIC firmware itself.
Calculation of the angles and user interface is contained by a PC
program, or possibly a program in a PDA.</p>

<h3>An analog sin-cos driver</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="stepper_files/sincos_osc.gif"></td>
<td><p>The circuit to the left consists of a low frequency triangle
wave generator and two integrators. The first integration of a triangle
wave yields a sinewave, and integration of a sine yields a cosine. The
generator is quite hard to tune, and probably not too stable.<br><br>
The integrators have a resistor in their feedback loop, to suppress DC
offsets. Also for that reason the generator and integrators are coupled
with C10.<br><br>
It must be noted that the phasedifference is slightly more than 90°,
but this probably doesn't harm too much. Amplitude difference can be
tuned by selecting a different value for R17.<br><br>
This circuit has been built an tested, but in general it sucks. This is
due to its frequency dependency and inherent instability.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>This is the circuit that converts the signal into the current
through the motorwindings. The OpAmps will regulate the voltage over
the 1&#937; emitter resistors, according to the input signal. Per motor half
the signal is inverted for one of the windings, which together with
diodes and transistors implicitly functions as a rectifier. The
non-inverting branch produces the current for the positive half period,
and the inverting branch for the negative half.<br><br>
The input signals for the winding couples are quadrature signals, i.e.
the sine and cosine from the generator circuit. This driver stage can
be used with other quadrature generators too, for example based on a
controller and a couple of DACs. In this case the current drivers can
be simpler, since any signal can be generated by the controller.<br><br>
The peak current for the floppy stepper is approximately 150mA, so the
signal at the input of the OpAmp should be comparable. This is achieved
with a 1/10 resistor divider for the non-inverting and a 0.1
amplification factor for the inverting branches.<br>

<h3>A digital sin-cos driver</h3>
<p>The analog quadrature oscillator appers to be extremely hard to get
stable, variable in frequency and amplitude, and to produce sine waves
at the same time. Therefore the next plan is to make a digital
oscillator with a PIC 18F452 and a pair of MAX534 DACs. Since the motor
only consumes 150mA, and the driving voltage is fairly smooth, the need
for real power transistors is relaxed. A set of darlingtons (bc517) are
used instead.<br><br>
